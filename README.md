## Materials required

- any code editor
- Linux
- Love2D

## Application installation

At the moment, there is no installer created;
You will need to copy the git ones then run the project with the command <code>love ./lovezirconia/</code>.<br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Some assets used are not covered by an open source license and therefore cannot be redistributed on the project's Git repository.<br> You will therefore need to add your own assets to the <code>assets/premium/</code> folder before compiling. ‚ö†Ô∏è<br>
üõ†Ô∏è The executable will be shared when development has progressed further. üõ†Ô∏è<br>
